        <div class="big px-2 lh-md">
          <p class="py-2">Head-worn sensing, especially embedded in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) head-mounted displays and smart glasses is currently increasingly moving away from niche applications and small-scale research prototypes to large-scale consumer adoption (e.g. Oculus Quest 2, Hololens 2, J!NS MEME, Bose Frames).</p>

          <p class="py-2">Significant progress in sensing technologies and modalities have lead to a constant increase of commercially available products and unobtrusive, affordable research prototypes. These recent advances allow us to extend the Eyewear Community to enable large scale in-situ studies, as one of the favored research methodologies in Ubiquitous Computing. One manifestation of this can already be observed in large scale dataset recording, eyewear student competitions and programming seminars.</p>

          <p class="py-2">In this workshop we focus on supporting these large-scale uses of eyewear computing, discussing lessons learned from early deployment and how to empower the community with better hardware/software prototyping tools as well as the establishment of open data sets.</p>


          <p class="py-2">In addition, we will discuss long-term psychological and physical impacts and risks of the technology that become increasingly important with a wider distribution of devices to consumers.</p>

          <p class="py-2">The proposed workshop will bring together researchers from a wide range of disciplines, such as mobile and ubiquitous computing, activity recognition eye tracking, optics, human vision and perception, usability, as well as systems engineering research. This year it will also bring in researchers from neuroscience, psychology and other fields that might want to apply or use the research systems. The workshop is a continuation from 2016/2018/2019 and will focus on discussing on how to democratizing tools for researchers who want to apply eyewear computing (sensing/interaction) in their fields, yet are no wearable computing experts or computer scientists.</p>

          <h5 class="my-3 mt-4">Welcome <span class="badge badge-warning mx-2 pb-2">10:00 - 11:30</span></h5>
          <p>The workshop will start with an introduction given by the workshop organizers in which they will summarize the workshop's motivation, goals, and outline (10:00-10:15).
This will be followed by short introductory presentations of the workshop participants (in Pecha Kucha style) to get familiar with each other and to get to know the topics they are working on.
The presentation session will be broken into two parts with a short break in between. This will allow enough time to discuss different ideas coming out from the presentations.</p>

<h5 class="my-3 mt-5">Keynotes <span class="badge badge-warning mx-2 pb-2">11:30 - 12:30</span></h5>
<p>One keynote will be given by Prof. Thad Starner (Georgia Tech).</p>
<p>Others will be announced later, stay tuned.</p>


<h5 class="my-3 mt-5">Demonstration Session</h5>
<p>We encourage participants to demonstrate research prototypes related to their submissions. Depending on the number of demonstrations we will hold a separate session or do small show-and-tells in small breaks.</p>

<h5 class="my-3 mt-5">Scenario Development <span class="badge badge-warning mx-2 pb-2">13:00 - 15:30</span></h5>
<p>After the presentations, grouped participants will develop new scenarios. All participants will write notes, which will posted on a virtual whiteboard. In order to sort out the challenges and opportunities for an Open Eyewear Platform, we will create an affinity diagram analysis of the gathered ideas. Group analysis will start at 15:00 and will end at 15:30.</p>

<h5 class="my-3 mt-5">Group Discussion <span class="badge badge-warning mx-2 pb-2">15:30 - 17:30</span></h5>
<p>After the group analysis, we will have a longer coffee break (15:30-16:00) followed by a discussion round on identified challenges and opportunities (16:00-17:00). Organizers will actively engage with the audience to stimulate discussions. We will summarize the key experiences from the workshop and will plan follow up activities (17:00-17:30).</p>

<h2 class="mt-5 pt-5 mb-3 border-top">Post-Workshop Follow Up</h2>
<p>Organizers will document the outcome of the above analysis, and make this information available to the all participants through a shared Google Drive folder. Participants will be invited to an existing Slack channel where they can share papers relevant to the workshop themes. We will start a Data-set directory on based on the participants submissions during the workshop to make it easier to access useful datasets and tools.</p>

           <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions"> the Precision conference Submissions Website </a>

         <p class="py-2 mb-4">   
          The human face, holding the majority of human senses, provides versatile information about a person's cognitive and affective states. Using head-worn technology, user states, such as reading, walking, detection of fatigue or cognitive load, can be recognized and enable new application scenarios, such as quantified self for the mind.
Besides, significant progress in sensing technologies and modalities have led to a constant increase in unobtrusive and affordable head-worn sensing devices, such as smart glasses like Google Glass or J!NS meme.
With the resulting increasing ubiquity of the technology, new opportunities arise for applications that track social behaviours and interactions between groups of people in real-world settings.</p>

<p class="py-4 pt-2">This workshop aims to identify key factors in large-scale uses of eyewear computing.
More precisely, we are going to summarize lessons learned from early deployment, focus on ways to empower the community with high-quality hardware and software prototyping tools, and will specifically discuss the establishment of open source datasets.
With the wider distribution of head-worn sensing technology to the public, long-term impacts of the technology become increasingly important.
Therefore, we also welcome topics that are concerned with physical or psychological aspects of head-worn sensing devices.
We invite submissions of position papers (2-4 pages in the ACM sigconf format, excluding references) that cover topics such as, but are not limited to:
</p>

<ul class="py-1 pb-4 bg-warning rounded-12 text-black px-5 py-4">
    <li> Open Eyewear Tools and Datasets </li>
    <li> Eyewear sensing and actuation technologies </li>
    <li> Smart Eyewear interactions </li>
    <li> Application scenarios of head-worn sensing/interaction devices </li>
    <li> Impact and Risks of long-term sensing </li>
    <li> Smart Eyewear User Experience Designs </li>
</ul>

<p class="py-4 mt-3">Submissions will go through a single-phase review process with at least 2 reviewers. They will be assessed based on their relevance, originality, and their potential of initiating a fruitful discussion at the workshop. Note, that position papers are not expected to present finished research projects. We rather ask for thought-provoking ideas or initial explorations of a topic. Position papers will be reviewed by two of the workshop organizers. At the workshop, accepted submissions will be presented in a 5-min prerecorded video, following the Pecha Kucha style. At least one author of an accepted submission must attend the workshop. </p>
